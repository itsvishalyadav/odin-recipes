    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="para">
      Lasagna isn’t just food—it’s an ancient, chaotic artifact made of cheese, sauce, and questionable Italian wizardry. Legend says if you stack more than 24 layers, you unlock the Pasta Paradox, tearing open a rift in space-time that smells faintly of oregano. Every time you microwave leftover lasagna at 3:06 AM, it whispers in Latin and tries to tell you the secrets of the universe, but only if your fridge light is flickering.

    <p class="para">
      Also, it’s the only known dish that, when stacked correctly, can form a functioning government—complete with cheesy diplomacy and noodle-based law enforcement. Lasagna once tried to run for office in 1994 but lost to a bowl of soup due to poor campaign marketing. Garfield wasn’t obsessed with lasagna. Lasagna was obsessed with Garfield. And if you listen closely, your oven might just ask you: “Do you believe in layers?”

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul class="para">
      <li>Lasagna sheets – Obviously. No sheets = sad pasta soup.</li>
      <li>Ground beef/pork – The juicy foundation of your meaty madness.</li>
      <li>Tomato sauce – The red stuff that makes everything Italian and dramatic.</li>
      <li>Ricotta or cottage cheese – For that creamy, cheesy middle layer. No skips.</li>
      <li>Mozzarella cheese – The gooey king. You need the stretch.</li>
      <li>Garlic + onion – The holy duo for flavor. Don’t you dare forget them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="para">
      <li>Cook chopped onion and garlic in a pan, then add ground meat and brown it.</li>
  <li>Pour in tomato sauce, season it up (salt, pepper, oregano), and simmer.</li>
  <li>Mix ricotta with a beaten egg and a little salt (optional: Parmesan).</li>
  <li>Layer in a baking dish: sauce → lasagna sheet → ricotta mix → mozzarella.</li>
  <li>Repeat layers till you're out of stuff; finish with mozzarella on top.</li>
  <li>Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
