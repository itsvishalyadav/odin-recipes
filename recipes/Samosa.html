    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="para">
      Samosa is the triangle-shaped legend of the streets, the crispy code of chaos stuffed with spicy secrets. It’s not just a snack—it’s a warm hug and a spicy punch rolled in flaky golden armor. Bite into one and you unlock memories, childhood trauma, and probably a second samosa.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      They say no one eats just one samosa. That’s not a challenge, it's a prophecy. It’s been the unofficial national currency for chai-time negotiations, wedding gossip, and exam results since time immemorial. Handle with care—it will burn your tongue and steal your heart.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="para">
      <li>All-purpose flour – For the crispy outer shell.</li>
      <li>Boiled potatoes – Mashed chaos inside.</li>
      <li>Green peas – Optional, but adds some class.</li>
      <li>Spices (cumin, garam masala, chili powder) – For the internal fireworks.</li>
      <li>Oil – For deep-frying your regrets to perfection.</li>
      <li>Salt – Because bland samosas are a crime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="para">
      <li>Make dough with flour, salt, and oil. Let it rest (like you should).</li>
      <li>Sauté mashed potatoes with spices and peas. Let flavors fight it out.</li>
      <li>Roll dough into circles, cut in half, and fold into cones.</li>
      <li>Stuff the cones with potato mix and seal them like top-secret files.</li>
      <li>Deep fry until golden and crispy. Ignore the oil judging you.</li>
      <li>Serve with chutney and pretend you’ll only eat one.</li>
    </ol>
